                <p><strong>Bridge Of Spies</strong> based on a true story is a absolutely brilliant film by Steven Spielberg. An insurance Brooklyn lawyer James Donovan was sent to represent a Soviet spy (Rudolf Abel).<br> An honorable lawyer he took up the defence that everyone deserve a right to be defended in a court of law even a spy or traitor. An illegal search  of Abel hotel room  without a warrant, he try to agrued the case on the grounds of the consistution to no avail. Adel was found guilt and was looking at a death sentence. Donovan went to the judge and argue at it made be the best interest of the United States to sentence Abel instead of the death penaty. Because, "It is possibe, in the foreseeable future that an American in the quivalent range will be capture in the Soviet Russia, we might want some to trade." This lead  to the decision of the judge to sentence Abel to thirty years. The country was angry with the decision and attack Donovan home because of it, but Donovan maintain that Abel as the right like any American to a fair trail and proceed to seek an appeal.
                </p>
                <p>Donovan received a letter from East Germany, for a person who claim be Abels' wife thanking him for what he has done. The CIA believe that it was a message that the Soviet was using as a trade with Abel for an American solider (Francis Gary Powers) who was capture and sentence to ten years. The CIA decided to sent Donovan to East Germany negotiate the transfer deal. When Donovan arrive in East Berlin, he learn that another American student (Frederic Pryor) studing Economics was in prison in East Germany. Donovan decided to negotiate for both Powers and Pryor, but the CIA only wants Donovan to negotiate for Powers. Donovan insisted that both Powers and Pryor will be exchange for Abel and send a message to the Athorney General of the German Democratic Republic who were looking to look good in the eyes of the United States, that they will either release Pryor with Powers or they will be no deal. The Bluff works and both Powers and Pryor was released and Abel was exchange to the Soviet who never acknowledge that Abel was a spy. On returning home, the United States acknowledge Donovan for the negotiation.
